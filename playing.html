      <h1>playing Dead cells</h1>
      <p>
        I can tell you how to play Dead cells on the <strong>x-box</strong> and
        only the x-box because I have never played Dead cells on anything
        else...here it is:B to roll, x to do first attack, y to do second
        attack, lb to pick things up, rt to heal(I think it is called rt, I
        don't know)
      </p>
